          Pieces are left to dry on the shelf for a week, then get turned, glazed, and wait for a kiln that we always
          fire full. That's why sold-out pieces take time to come back.

          We buy oak, ash, elm and a little walnut as boards, not sheets, and cut everything to size here. Every joint
          is made so it can be taken apart again, because a chair that can't be repaired has an expiry date.

          Nothing is lacquered. Oil marks more easily and needs redoing every few years, but it means a scratch sands
          out instead of staying.

                I bought two mugs in 2021 expecting them to be the nice ones you keep in the cupboard. They have been in
                daily use ever since. Four winters, a house move and a toddler, and not a chip between them.
